# Arduino Snake
An arduino uno r3 snake using a Joystick and a 8x8 LED matrix. Made it just to learn how to use an arduino. It might be buggy. After you loose you can startover by clicking the joystick. You can make the game harder or easier by changeing the MSPerMovement variable. Everything is hard coded so if you want to use it you might need to tweak some things.
